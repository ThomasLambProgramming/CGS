Structure of node baking

find marked/all gameobjects 
	check for mesh renderer
		check every vertex for overlaps and then do the underneath check

//possibly have more checks like a xz distance bounds kind of thing

add all passing verts to list

//this way we are only checking the positions rather than the nodes then managing the connections and etc
//and the mesh can be made after with only the verts that matter
//mininum is needed for doing the xz collision checks
//if y difference is greater than max y difference then we dont check (knowing its too large)
//if a node is too far away from any point then we can remove (a no connection node is just unwanted memory)

do underneath checks on all verts against all verts
//at this point no links should be made and only the positions are needed

//by this point all overlaps should be done so we can send all vert vec3 positions to the gpu to link
//gpu should give back array of nodes with their connections
each node gets its own (whatever the thread is) to search through the other positions to see if they link

returns the node and its links
add all nodes into one array = nodegraph



//check how memory works on the compute shaders first

	position
